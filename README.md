# Group Theory Lean
This is an exercise on taking notes on WR Scott's Group Theory
in the [lean prover language](https://leanprover.github.io). The goals are
* to learn more about the lean theorem prover.
* to see how a theorem user can be employed to learn math and do book exercises.

## Why Group Theory?
Being new to lean, I chose subject that is easy to formalize and for which resources exist (e.g. [here](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Students/zipperer_ms_thesis.pdf) 
and [here](https://tqft.net/web/notes/load.php?name=students/20180219-MitchRowett-ASC-report-on-Lean)).
